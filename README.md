# About #
This project is a simple demo to understand MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture using Node.js, Express, and SQLite.

# What is MVC? #
Model – Handles data and database operations
View – Displays data to the user
Controller – Handles requests and connects Model and View

# How It Works #
User sends request from browser
Controller receives the request
Controller calls the Model
Model fetches data from Database
Controller sends data to View
View renders HTML response
